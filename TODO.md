The main idea is creating a program to keep a record of the cube times, just as a beginning.

As a second goal, there's the option of getting scrambles and an actual usable timer to no depend on
other timers.

The first things are getting the structures to save the times and the data related to them, with an appropriate
GUI.

Once we have that, we can go to the timer section.

As a future goal, making an option to import/export «proprietary» collections of data, with maybe options to work
with some storage services.

TODO List:
-----Phase1
- Database
- Data Analysis Tools
- GUI
- Input-Output procedures

-----Phase2
- Timer
- Scrambler

-----Phase3
- Import/Export
